            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I'm a second-year grad student at Boston University, pursuing an MS in Software Development with a concentration in
                Web App Development. In my previous career I was a staff director at a mental health treatment center, and I'm
                passionate about the intersection of mental health care and technology.

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I love strength training (especially chin-ups and heavy deadlifts), making oat bread, freelance fiction editing,
                and hanging out with my mom.
            </p>
